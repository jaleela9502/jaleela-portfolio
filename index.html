<p>My biggest dream is to go to the holy place Mecca and Madinah. Mecca officially Makkah al-Mukarramah and commonly shortened to Makkah is a city and administrative center of the Mecca Province of Saudi Arabia, and the holiest city in Islam. 
 The Great Mosque of Mecca, known as the Masjid al-Haram, is home to the Ka'bah, believed by Muslims to have been built by ibrahim(alai) and ismail(alai). It is one of Islam's holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims (qibla).
Medina is one of Islam's two holiest cities, making it a key destination for millions of pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia for Hajj or Umrah. The city is centered around Al Masjid an Nabawi, also known as the Prophet's Mosque, which was constructed by the Prophet himself and is also where he is buried.</p>
